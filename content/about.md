By day I wear the title of DevOps Engineer but feel more like a Jenkins wrangler and a Chef trickster. By night I get frustrated by JavaScript, dream in Python, and build startup products. And over lunch breaks I run Code Epic under AkronWIT. Sometimes I submit talks, and some more times I get accepted to give those talks at conferences and meetups.
